Things I didn't get completed due to time constraints but wanted to implement.

- Unit Test for Calculation Methods.
- Further validation for number inputs. On device or simulator, only a numeric keyboard shows, but a bluetooth keyboard will still allow text input.

The project should be able to be run from Xcode without any issues or specifics.
