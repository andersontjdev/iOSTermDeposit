Things I didn't get completed due to time constraints but wanted to implement.

- Unit Test for Calculation Methods.
- Further validation for number inputs. On device or simulator, only a numeric keyboard shows, but a bluetooth keyboard will still allow text input.
- I have also noticed an issue with the calculations for Interest Paid Quarterly or Annually if there is a remainder (eg. 14 months or 23 months). I have found a way to fix it implementing remainders and calculating interest differently for remainder months etc. But also didn't want to go over the time limit assigned for the coding challenge, so I figured it would make a good discussion point.

The project should be able to be run from Xcode without any issues or specifics.
